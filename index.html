    <p>
        The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take an array of numbers <br>
        as its argument and return the two highest numbers within the array. The returned value should <br>
        be an array in the format [second oldest age,  oldest age].<br>
        <br>
        The order of the numbers passed in could be any order. The array will always include at least <br>
        2 items. If there are two or more oldest age, then return both of them in array format.<br>
        <br>
        For example (Input --> Output):<br>
        <br>
        [1, 2, 10, 8] --> [8, 10]<br>
        [1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8] --> [45, 87]<br>
        [1, 3, 10, 0]) --> [3, 10]<br>
            </p>
